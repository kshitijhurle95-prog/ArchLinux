// Perf is the shell's one performance-policy singleton and the single reader of
// ~/.config/ryoku/performance.json (the file Ryoku Settings' Performance page
// writes). It folds four inputs into the effective switches every surface obeys:
//
//   1. the explicit user toggles in performance.json (lowPowerMode is the master),
//   2. the active power profile (PowerProfiles), when powerProfileEffects is on,
//   3. the live battery state (Battery), for invisible savings while discharging,
//   4. Game Mode (Flags.gameMode), which outranks all of them.
//
// Consumers read the derived booleans (blurDisabled, shadowsDisabled, reduceMotion,
// visualizerFrozen, pillFrozen) instead of re-deriving `lowPower || flag`: the
// "lowPowerMode implies ..." and "Power Saver implies ..." rules live here once.
// Motion reads reduceMotion/motionSpeed from here too, so the whole shell shares
// one file watcher rather than a copy per module.
//
// Tiers: only Power Saver forces eye-candy off (it behaves like lowPowerMode).
// Balanced and Performance leave the explicit toggles untouched, so the default
// profile never overrides a user's choice and the desktop stays smooth. Battery
// thrift (slower background polling, and not waking a suspended dGPU) is graceful
// and applies whenever discharging, independent of the profile, because it costs
// the user nothing they can see.
//
// Game Mode is the one tier that ignores the user's explicit toggles, and it is
// meant to: the compositor is already stripped and the CPU is already pinned to
// performance, so leaving the shell's own eye-candy running would spend the
// headroom that was just bought. It is also the only tier where the shell is
// competing with a specific foreground process for the same GPU, which is why it
// goes further than Saver and drops the audio analyser outright rather than
// merely freezing it when idle. Nothing here is persisted: it lasts exactly as
// long as the toggle, and every switch returns to the user's own settings on
// exit.

    // all". The first is what shipped, and it cost two cava processes plus a
    // permanently damaged surface keeping the compositor awake.
    //
    // Silence is now the gate, unconditionally: there is no sensible reason to
    // spectrum-analyse an idle sink, so the old opt-in keys no longer take part.

    // Ambient motion with nothing playing: the bar's stream drifting on a passive
    // sine when the desktop is silent. Allowed on Balanced and Performance,
    // refused by the hard tiers, so the power profile decides it the way it
    // decides the rest of the eye-candy.
    //
    // Separate from the two freeze flags above on purpose. There is never a reason
    // to spectrum-analyse silence, so cava stops either way; drifting a few pixels
    // is a different question, and on a machine the user has put in Performance
    // the answer is yes.
    //
    // Two questions, not one. ambientMotion answers "may it move at all"; fullRate
    // answers "may it move at the full frame rate the animation was designed for".
    //
    // The second exists because the gap animations were deliberately throttled: the
    // pacing picks a slow tier for a field that is only drifting or charging rather
    // than moving fast, which is why mode 3 (Bolt) settles at 160ms and reads as
    // steppy no matter which profile is active. That throttle was the right answer
    // to Bolt costing ~40% of a core, but it is the wrong answer on Performance,
    // where the user has already said to spend the power and expects the animation
    // to look the way it was drawn.
    //
    // So Performance paces at full rate whenever there is anything to draw, and
    // every other profile keeps the throttle. A fully dark frame still backs off
    // everywhere: there is no point painting nothing quickly.
    //
    // Priced by instrumenting the paint handler rather than by guessing from the
    // outside, which is what it took: earlier attempts compared CPU across power
    // profile switches and measured mostly noise, and none of it was even the
    // stream, because a bar with barAnim 0 never loads it at all.
    //
    // With mode 3 (Bolt) actually running, silent desktop: the paint handler picks
    // tick=33 on Performance against tick=160 on Balanced, confirmed over hundreds
    // of frames. The cost of that is real -- shell 42-54% of a core and Hyprland
    // ~16% -- which is the same bill the throttle was introduced to remove. That is
    // the deal Performance is asking for, and it is why every other profile keeps
    // the throttle.

    // Graceful cost knobs. Multiply a base poll interval by pollFactor: a second of

    // poll is a process spawn competing with the game for the same cores.
